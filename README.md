# Welcome to my Portfolio
Techdegree Unit 6 Project
Static, Node.js and Express Site

**Purpose:**
This is my profolio showcasing a collection of full stack projects and apps. This project was created using Node.js, Express, Pug templates, and utilizing static assets. I really enjoyed working with server and wokring through the backend. I created four routes and handlers for errors. This is the final project for Unit 6 of the Treehouse Techdegree.

**Challenges:**
My challenges included learning host javascript objects and learning a new Pug language.
