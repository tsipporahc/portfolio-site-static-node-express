          p In the last 6 years, I contributed significantly to the growth and development of the English and Science department made up of over 900 Japanese highschool students.I spearheaded a new "Science in English" Technology curriiculum to fit student needs by assessing their strengths and limitations. The course increase their computer literacy skills by conducting science labs and rocket simulations in english. Secondly, I drove the development of collaborative language exchange programs and built partnerships with schools and Japan, usa, South africa, and Korea by utilizing technologies such as Flipgrid, Microsoft Teams and Zoom.
          p As a result of my curriculum, students were able to make friends from all over the world and experience the role of technology and broadening and gaining a greater understanding of the world. By facilitating this cross-cultural technology centered experience, I realize I wanted to have a say in the development of technologies that are shaping the minds of our students and I want to use technology to bring the world closer and provide opportunities to all.
